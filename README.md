## Security Question?

Often there are many security questions.  I find that I will not only forget the answer. But they could also be public, in the way everyone knows the answer, or private, in which case I don't want to share.

The Security Question Answer Generator, solves all your problems. Choose a fixed password, or something common that you will you to encrypt all your answers.  This password will encrypt the security question giving you a constant answer to every question.  Using the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm, your password + the security question will generate a single answer.  This will both guarantee all your answers are unique and private.

Generates answers to security questions, so you don't have to.
